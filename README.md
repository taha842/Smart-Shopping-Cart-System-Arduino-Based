# Smart-Shopping-Cart-System-Arduino-Based


This project focuses on the design and implementation of SMART SHOPPING CART.A device “SMART SHOPPING CART” also called as “Data Logger 
Device” is an information storage system. Here the system parameters of an Intelligent Bucket like products name, products amount etc.
are continuously recorded and displays the name of the product with its cost.This project is specially targeted at the owners of 
commercial customer’s ease of their shopping.


The proposed system in this thesis will be implemented into two parts . First part is the initialization of the Arduino controller for 
the set up of RFID Reader and Bluetooth. Second part is the tag detection of products by RFID Reader which are placed in the cart and 
sending of product information from cart to Central billing unit through Bluetooth. The overview working of this system is - This proposed 
system works as on customer getting into the mall she/he first takes a trolley.
